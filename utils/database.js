Database must be structured as:

CREATE TABLE `login_service` (

  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `password` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`user_id`))   

  Using MySQL. You can use another DB, and other attributes, variable names but code must change too

/*
One important thing to note is, and I will probably try this, you can create a .env file and declare a variable, set that variable to your password.

By doing this, this file will never be uploaded to github, so your database password will never be exposed
